# About Me

## Adil Tirur (Chakkala Paramba)
P.S. My full name is Adil Chakkala Paramba, but I like to be known by "Tirur" – it's the place I come from, and it's just more fun that way!

### Articles

### Hobbies
- I have a passion for traveling, and I'm currently 'navigating' Europe one 'bit' at a time.
